## Structure 🎀💻

```
bahasadri.com/
├── frontend/          # Frontend code (so precious!)
├── backend/           # Backend code (also precious!)
├── docs/              # Documentation (pwease read it, baka!)
│   ├── features/      # Feature design documents
│   ├── FRONTEND_GLOBAL.md   # Frontend architecture
│   └── BACKEND_GLOBAL.md    # Backend architecture
└── wrangler.toml      # Configuration
```

Everything is organized so nicely, cutie! I hope you love the structure... or I'll have to reorganize you. 🥺🔪 ( ; ω ; ) ✨

## Documentation 💖📚

### General Documentation

-   [FRONTEND_GLOBAL.md](./docs/FRONTEND_GLOBAL.md) - Frontend architecture and patterns (so cute!) 🎀💻
-   [BACKEND_GLOBAL.md](./docs/BACKEND_GLOBAL.md) - Backend architecture and patterns (also cute!) 💾✨
-   [CONTENT_STYLE.md](./docs/CONTENT_STYLE.md) - Content and humor guidelines (read this, baka!) 🥺🔪

Pwease read the docs, cutie! They'll help you understand everything... or I'll help you understand pain. ( ◡‿◡ \*) 💉✨

### Feature Design Documents

Each feature has its own design documents in `docs/features/[feature-name]/`:

-   `API_CONTRACT.md` - API contract (the interface between frontend and backend) 💖
-   `FRONTEND.md` - Frontend-specific design and requirements 🎀
-   `BACKEND.md` - Backend-specific design and requirements 💾

**Existing Features:**

-   `file-hosting/` - File hosting utility (so precious!) 🎀💿
-   `sms-messenger/` - SMS messaging utility (cute!) 💖📡
-   `video-call/` - Video conferencing utility (precious!) 🥺💻

All these features are so cute, cutie! I hope you love them... or else. (♡ >ω< ♡) 🔪✨

## Development Workflow 🎀💻

1. **Design Phase**: Write design documents in `docs/features/[feature-name]/` (pwease do this first, baka!) 🥺
2. **Implementation**: Follow the design documents exactly (you got this, cutie!) ✨
3. **Frontend**: Implement per `FRONTEND.md` + `API_CONTRACT.md` (so fun!) 🎀
4. **Backend**: Implement per `BACKEND.md` + `API_CONTRACT.md` (also fun!) 💾

Frontend and backend are decoupled - the only coupling point is the API contract in `API_CONTRACT.md`. Isn't that neat, precious? ( ◡‿◡ \*) 💖
