## Glossary

* [What is Voice Trace?](/docs/glossary/what-voice-trace.md): Voice trace is a voice quality troubleshooting feature that captures the media stream for calls and stores them for Twilio Support to use in their investigations. 
* [What is a Virtual Phone Number?](/docs/glossary/what-virtual-phone-number.md): A virtual phone number is a standard telephone number that is not locked down to a specific phone. A virtual number can route a voice call or text message to any phone or workflow. With virtual numbers powered by an API, complex software workflows can be built that are triggered by calls and texts.
* [What is UTF-8?](/docs/glossary/what-utf-8.md): UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding standard that uses between one and four eight-bit bytes to represent all valid Unicode code points.
* [What is an SMS tracker?](/docs/glossary/what-sms-tracker.md): An SMS tracker is software that uncovers detailed information about the delivery and content of text and picture messages. It allows anyone to analyze an individual message or group of messages to see delivery patterns, encoding details, and error conditions.
   
* [Messaging Character Limits](/docs/glossary/what-sms-character-limit.md): A single SMS message technically supports up to 160 characters, or up to 70 if the message contains one or more Unicode characters (such as emoji or Chinese characters).
  However, modern phones and mobile networks support message concatenation, which enables longer messages to be sent. Messages longer than 160 characters are automatically split into parts (called "segments") and then re-assembled when they are received. Message concatenation allows you to send long SMS messages, but this increases your per-message cost, because SMS are billed per segment.
  The 160-character limit is for messages encoded using the GSM-7 character set. Messages not encoded with GSM-7 are limited to 70 characters. For detail on how these character limits change on concatenated (multi-segment) messages, see below.
  Twilio's platform supports long messages up to 1600 characters across all Programmable Messaging channels, including SMS and RCS. However, for SMS messaging, Twilio recommends sending messages that are no more than 320 characters to ensure the best deliverability and user experience. &#x20;
  RCS supports a more size-efficient character encoding scheme called UTF-8.  With UTF-8, Unicode characters are natively supported and take up less character-length space that would otherwise lead to higher segment counts over SMS.
* [What is a Long Code?](/docs/glossary/what-long-code-phone-number.md): A long code number is a standard phone number used to send and receive voice calls and SMS messages. Phone numbers are typically called "long codes" (10-digit numbers in many countries) when comparing them with SMS short codes (5-6 digit numbers).

* [What is SIP Trunking?](/docs/glossary/what-is-sip-trunking.md): What is SIP Calling?
  SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking refers to phone calls that are routed over the Internet rather than traditional phone lines. SIP calling, therefore, refers to the act of placing calls via a SIP trunk. Because SIP calls take place across the Internet, they tend to be cheaper and more efficient than calls placed through traditional phone systems.
  Physical connections to a phone company are eliminated with the use of a SIP trunk. Using SIP trunks, a SIP provider can connect multiple channels to your private branch exchange (Voice-over-IP (VoIP) infrastructure.
* [What is Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)?](/docs/glossary/what-is-session-initiation-protocol-sip.md): Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signalling protocol for initiating, terminating, and modifying user sessions over an IP network.  Most commonly, SIP is used for Voice Over IP (VoIP) services, but is also often used for other communications sessions such as video calls and instant messaging sessions.
* [What is a Push Notification?](/docs/glossary/what-is-push-notification.md): A push notification (also known as a server push notification) is the delivery of information to a computing device from an application server where the request for the transaction is initiated by the server rather than by an explicit request from the client. While 'push notification' is most often used to refer to notifications on mobile devices, web applications also leverage this technology.
* [What is Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?](/docs/glossary/what-is-personally-identifiable-information-pii.md): Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or personal data, is data that corresponds to a single person.

  Most often judged on a scale of 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent), Mean Opinion Scores are the average of a number of other human-scored individual parameters.  Although originally Mean Opinion Scores were derived from surveys of expert observers, today a MOS is often produced by an Objective Measurement Method approximating a human ranking.
* [Masked Calling](/docs/glossary/what-is-masked-calling.md): Masked Calling is a technique used in ecommerce to protect buyers' and sellers' personal phone numbers. Each party gets a temporary number, allowing them to communicate for a specified time period. When the time period expires, the numbers are recycled and reassigned to other parties on the platform. This prevents transactions from happening outside the platform.
