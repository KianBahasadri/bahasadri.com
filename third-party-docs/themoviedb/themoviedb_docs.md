But now five years later, with the kids busy growing up and Mike growing restless, it just might be time for him to get back to work. Having never wanted Mike to leave in the first place, his old boss Harris Green jumped at the chance to get him back on TV. The trick, as it’s always been, was to make Mike think it was his idea. After several – okay, many - failed attempts, Mike’s family, anxious to see him out of the house, finally succeeded in getting him to “run into” Green. Now their plan is in motion. He’ll be back to juggling home, family, and career, just like the old days – only better.",

The series has featured actors and actresses such as Christopher Eccleston, Benjamin Smith, Juliet Stevenson, Andy Serkis, Marc Warren, Naomie Harris, Sean Bean and Anne-Marie Duff as the accused in each episode.\\n\\nThe series follows previous drama series by McGovern, including anthology series The Street and Moving On. After the cancellation of The Street in 2009 by Granada Television, McGovern formed RSJ Films to produce independent drama programmes and consequently devised the Accused anthology series. Accused is written by McGovern, Danny Brocklehurst and Alice Nutter and is filmed in Manchester. In 2011 it won an International Emmy for best drama series.",

Guest sessions are a special kind of session that give you _some_ of the functionality of an account, but not all. For example, some of the things you can do with a guest session are; maintain a rated list, a watchlist and a favourite list.

Guest sessions will automatically be deleted if they are not used within 60 minutes of it being issued.

https://api.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/token/validate\_with\_login

This method allows an application to validate a request token by entering a username and password.

Not all applications have access to a web view so this can be used as a substitute.

Please note, the preferred method of validating a request token is to have a user authenticate the request via the TMDB website. You can read about that method [here](_reference_authentication-how-do-i-generate-a-session-id.md).

If you decide to use this method please **use HTTPS**.

Use this method to create a v3 session ID if you already have a valid v4 access token. The v4 token needs to be authenticated by the user. Your standard "read token" will not validate to create a session ID.

This would replace step 3 from the [How do I generate a session id?](_reference_authentication-how-do-i-generate-a-session-id.md) guide.

As outlined in the [getting started guide](_docs_getting-started.md), the basics to getting a user authenticated look like this:

1.  Create a new request token
2.  Get the user to authorize the request token
3.  Create a new session id with the athorized request token
4.  Part 1 and 3 should be fairly easy to understand but I'll walk through each step to make sure it's clear.

The first step as a developer is to request a new token. This is a temporary token that is required to ask the user for permission to access their account. This token will auto expire after 60 minutes if it's not used.

With a request token in hand, forward your user to the following URL:
```
https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/{REQUEST_TOKEN}
```
You can also pass this URL a `redirect_to` parameter, ie:
```
https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/{REQUEST_TOKEN}?redirect_to=http://www.yourapp.com/approved
```
Once the user has approved your request token, they will either be redirected to the URL you specified in the `redirect_to` parameter or to the `/authenticate/allow` path on TMDB. If they aren't redirected to a custom URL, the page will also have a `Authentication-Callback` header. This header contains the API call for step #3. You can either manually generate it or simply use the one we return.

By calling the new session method with the request token that has been approved by the user in step 2, we will return a new session\_id. This is the session that can now be used to write user data. You should treat this key like a password and keep it secret.

A guest session can be used to rate movies without having a registered TMDB user account. For more information about how to create a guest session see here.

A filmek cselekménye a Galaktikus Köztársaság és a Galaktikus Birodalom közti átmenetek, valamint a Galaktikus Polgárháború (amely a Lázadó Szövetség és a Galaktikus Birodalom között zajlik) körül forog. Valójában az egész cselekmény a jó és a rossz harcát jelképezi. A történet „réges régen, egy messzi-messzi galaxisban…” játszódik. Az eredeti Csillagok háborúja-trilógia, főleg annak elsőként vetített része, az Egy új remény (IV. epizód) úttörő jelentőségű volt a sci-fi műfajában mind tartalmilag, mind a technikai megvalósítást tekintve, de az előzmény-trilógia (Baljós árnyak, A klónok támadása, A Sith-ek bosszúja) is számos újítást hozott magával.",

A questo film sono seguite altre due pellicole, distribuite a tre anni di distanza l'una dall'altra: L'Impero colpisce ancora (1980) e Il ritorno dello Jedi (1983). Questi tre film costituiscono la cosiddetta \\"trilogia originale\\". Sedici anni dopo l'uscita dell'ultimo film, Lucas decise di girare una trilogia prequel, composta da La minaccia fantasma (1999), L'attacco dei cloni (2002) e La vendetta dei Sith (2005). Nel 2012 The Walt Disney Company acquistò infine i diritti della serie e avviò la produzione di una trilogia sequel con Il risveglio della Forza (2015), Gli ultimi Jedi (2017) e L'ascesa di Skywalker (2019). Essa è stata alternata a una serie Anthology che include Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) e Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018).",

        "overview": "《星球大战》(英语：Star Wars)，中文可简称“星战”，是美国导演兼编剧乔治·卢卡斯所构思拍摄的一系列科幻电影。同时“星球大战”也是该系列电影最早拍摄上映的第四章故事的原始片名。从1970年代末到1980年代，卢卡斯出品了《星球大战》三部曲。他曾说明第一部星战（第四部曲）的人物及故事是参照日本导演黑泽明的《战国英豪》(隠し砦の三悪人)所创作而成；原三部曲以二战英德大战为架构并溶入美国西部片及日本武士刀剧的节奏；蕴涵了太空冒险、希腊神话的大视野制作。影片中所使用的特效技术重新定义并改变了往后太空科幻片的未来发展。1990年代末，基于各界要求又拍摄了原三部曲之前的故事，又称“星战前传”。同时他把最初的三部曲改为六部系列的第四、五、六集，并将最早的第四集改名为“新希望”（A New Hope）。2012年10月，华特迪士尼公司以40.5亿美元收购卢卡斯影业。该片描写，在很久以前，一个遥远的银河系，肩负正义使命的绝地武士与帝国邪恶黑暗势力作战的故事。本片开启好莱坞电影商品授权的庞大事业，旗下分别有小说、漫画、玩具与电玩游戏等相关周边产业，系列中每部电影，小说与电玩游戏，皆以“很久以前，在一个遥远的银河系……”(A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...)开头。",

> There are two image formats that are supported for companies, PNG's and SVG's. You can see which type the original file is by looking at the `file_type` field. We prefer SVG's as they are resolution independent and as such, the width and height are only there to reflect the original asset that was uploaded. An SVG can be scaled properly beyond those dimensions if you call them as a PNG.
> 
> For more information about how SVG's and PNG's can be used, take a read through [this document](_docs_images.md).

get

https://api.themoviedb.org/3/configuration/primary\_translations

Get a list of the officially supported translations on TMDB.

While it's technically possible to add a translation in any one of the [languages](_reference_configuration-languages.md) we have added to TMDB (we don't restrict content), the ones listed in this method are the ones we also support for localizing the website with which means they are "primary" translations.

These are all specified as [IETF tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) to identify the languages we use on TMDB. There is one exception which is [image languages](_docs_image-languages.md). They are currently only designated by a ISO-639-1 tag. This is a planned upgrade for the future.

We're always open to adding more if you think one should be added. You can ask about getting a new primary translation added by posting on [the forums](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/category/5047954b760ee3369b000001).

One more thing to mention, these are the translations that map to our website translation project. You can view and contribute to that project [here](https://www.localeapp.com/projects/8267).

get

https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie

Find movies using over 30 filters and sort options.

If you specify the region parameter, the regional release date will be used instead of the primary release date. The date returned will be the first date based on your query (ie. if a `with_release_type` is specified). It's important to note the order of the release types that are used. Specifying `2|3` would return the limited theatrical release date as opposed to `3|2` which would return the theatrical date.

Also note that a number of filters support being comma (`,`) or pipe (`|`) separated. Comma's are treated like an `AND` query while pipe's are treated like an `OR`. This allows for quite complex filtering depending on your desired results.

      "overview": "Thanos hat also tatsächlich Wort gehalten, seinen Plan in die Tat umgesetzt und die Hälfte allen Lebens im Universum ausgelöscht. Die Avengers? Machtlos. Iron Man und Nebula sitzen auf dem Planeten Titan fest, während auf der Erde absolutes Chaos herrscht. Doch dann finden Captain America und die anderen überlebenden Helden auf der Erde heraus, dass Nick Fury vor den verheerenden Ereignissen gerade noch ein Notsignal absetzen konnte, um Verstärkung auf den Plan zu rufen. Die Superhelden-Gemeinschaft bekommt mit Captain Marvel kurzerhand tatkräftige Unterstützung im Kampf gegen ihren vermeintlich übermächtigen Widersacher. Und dann ist da auch noch Ant-Man, der wie aus dem Nichts auftaucht und sich der Truppe erneut anschließt, um die ganze Sache womöglich doch noch zu einem guten Ende zu bringen …",

      "overview": "Nachdem viele der X-Men gestorben sind und die Allianz der Kämpfer mit den übernatürlichen Kräften aufgelöst wurde, befindet sich Logan aka Wolverine in einer Situation, in der er von der Verantwortung gegenüber seinem alten Team entbunden ist. Auf der Suche nach einem Grund zu leben, begibt er sich in das moderne Japan. Dort trifft er sowohl ihm gut und schlecht gesonnene Menschen und muss sich fragen, wem er trauen kann. Neben Feinden wie Industriellen, Politikern, Frauen und Ninjas trifft er auch auf seinen Erzfeind: Kenuichio Harada, besser bekannt als Silver Samurai. Als Mutant kann er verschiedene Stoffe mit Energie beladen und so mit seinem Samurai-Stahl jede Materie durchdringen. Wolverine entdeckt zum ersten Mal, dass es etwas gibt, das ihn verwundbar macht und stößt an seine körperlichen und emotionalen Grenzen. In einem seiner schwierigsten Kämpfe stellt er sich seiner eigenen Unsterblichkeit.",

      "overview": "Nachdem er bei einem biochemischen Experiment so stark verstrahlt wurde, dass er sich, wann immer er gereizt oder wütend wird, in das grüne Monstrum Hulk verwandelt, lebt der Wissenschaftler Bruce Banner ein zurückgezogenes Leben im brasilianischen Exil. Dorthin hat es ihn auf der Flucht vor dem Militärgeneral Ross verschlagen, der alles unternimmt, um den ehemaligen Freund seiner Tochter Betty für seine Zwecke zu missbrauchen. Während sich für Banner die Uhr rückwärts dreht, er nach einem Gegenmittel für die Mutation forscht und seine Wut unter Kontrolle zu bringen versucht, unterläuft ihm ein Missgeschick: General Ross gelingt es, Banner ausfindig zu machen. Auf der Flucht vor dem Militär und dem ehrgeizigen Soldaten Blonsky sucht er Zuflucht bei Betty, die ihm dabei hilft, die unfreiwilligen Superkräfte zu kontrollieren. Blonsky hat sich Banners einstige Formel zueigen gemacht und ist zur Kampfbestie Abomination mutiert.",

      "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\\r\\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Fincher’s new film, Mank, is coming soon on Netflix, released six years after his latest installment, Gone Girl. Therefore, this week I’m reviewing five of Fincher’s movies. Se7en was the first one, and now it’s time for one of the most culturally impactful films of the 90s, Fight Club. This is another rewatch of another filmmaking classic, one that I was never able to absolutely adore like most people. When this movie came out in 1999, critics were extremely divided, and the film failed at the box office. With time, it gained a cult following through home media, but it’s still considered a very controversial piece of cinema. So, nothing new, having in mind Fincher is at the helm.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite this being my third or fourth time experiencing this story, I never really changed my opinion about it, which is a bit uncommon in my viewing history. Usually, after multiple rewatches, my overall thoughts about a movie slightly vary, but Fight Club is one of the few exceptions. I believe my opinion remains intact from the very first watch. I really enjoy this film, but I can’t state that I absolutely love it. Since this is a special case, I’m going to start with what still bothers me after so many viewings, something I also rarely do in my reviews since I always leave the bad stuff to the end of the article.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout spoiling anything, of course, there’s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative. Jim Uhls’ screenplay relies on the main characters’ friendship to carry the story forward, and throughout the first two acts, Fincher leaves not-that-subtle hints to a massive revelation, which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act. This major plot point is brilliantly executed, and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery, both in terms of the dialogue and the performances. However, its impact on any lightly focused, observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this development.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I don’t want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says, “I guessed the twist before its revelation, hence it all sucks”. Like I insinuate above, I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act. Nevertheless, Fight Club’s runtime is far from being short, and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the film’s midpoint. It changes the protagonist’s perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don’t feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end… at least, not in its entirety.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn’t completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer’s imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout spoiling anything, of course, there’s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative. Jim Uhls’ screenplay relies on the main characters’ friendship to carry the story forward, and throughout the first two acts, Fincher leaves not-that-subtle hints to a massive revelation, which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act. This major plot point is brilliantly executed, and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery, both in terms of the dialogue and the performances. However, its impact on any lightly focused, observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this development.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I don’t want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says, “I guessed the twist before its revelation, hence it all sucks”. Like I insinuate above, I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act. Nevertheless, Fight Club’s runtime is far from being short, and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the film’s midpoint. It changes the protagonist’s perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don’t feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end… at least, not in its entirety.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn’t completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer’s imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon’t worry, I’m done with the negatives, and don’t forget: I really, really like this movie. Obviously, Fincher and Uhls created a story packed with underlying themes and social commentary. From the whole consumerism theory to the more psychological component regarding Edward Norton’s mental state, every message is seamlessly communicated to the audience. I’ve also been through a point in my life where I wish I’d be someone else, someone who had already achieved every dream of mine successfully with an overwhelming feeling of fulfillment. Coping with the inability to become that perfect someone can become an excruciating, sad, depressing process, and it varies drastically from person to person.\\r\\n\\r\\nFight Club approaches mental health and people’s acceptance of who they truly are in a groundbreaking manner, capturing Edward Norton’s emotions perfectly and broadcasting his thoughts through some of the best narration in the history of cinema. Its take on the world of consumerism is undoubtedly interesting and plays a big part in the climax of the film. Despite the issues described above, Uhls’ screenplay is very well-written, elevating the conversations between Norton and Brad Pitt (Ad Astra, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), which are indeed remarkably entertaining. Predictable or not, the main story is wonderfully executed by Fincher, who continues to demonstrate his impressive technical attributes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, the pre-production phase is proved here to be as important as any other stage in the filmmaking process. Fincher’s dedication to his features is palpable and visible on-screen through every single technical aspect. This time, Fincher brought in Jeff Cronenweth as the director of photography, and both worked together to not only create that desaturated, realistic atmosphere that Fincher loves so much but also to deliver the brutal, violent, bloody fight scenes that keep the entertainment levels at their highest. With clean, consistent, coherent editing from James Haygood, the movie flows beautifully despite its lengthy runtime. The Dust Brothers’ score is quite alternative, which suits the also unconventional storytelling.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast but not least, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. I know it’s incredibly cliche to write that two actors share impeccable chemistry, but Norton and Pitt take it to a whole other level. In two physically-demanding displays, both actors deliver award-worthy performances that marked their careers. Pitt offers one of his most underrated portrayals, being extremely funny throughout the entire film, but also astonishingly badass, carrying his fight sequences as amazing as he does with his dialogues. On the other hand, seeing Norton go all-out is a terrific experience. I lack words to describe such an emotionally compelling interpretation, filled with powerful character moments. A final word of praise to Helena Bonham Carter (Enola Holmes), who also delivers an exceptional performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, Fight Club is and will probably remain David Fincher’s most controversial movie for a long, long time. With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution, Fincher uses Jim Uhls’ captivating, layered, unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism, society’s behavior, and mental health, seamlessly transmitting meaningful yet contentious messages. Once again, the filmmaking in display is technically flawless, going from the trademark authentic cinematography and production design to the unique score, all flowing superbly through excellent editing. Unfortunately, I don’t belong to the group of people who utterly love this film. The excessive (sometimes unnecessary) use of flashbacks doesn’t help, but it’s the enormous build-up packed with overly explicit clues to a significant (yet unsurprising) plot twist that ends up partially ruining the viewing for me. I also wish that the script developed a few plot points more ambiguously, but Brad Pitt and Edward Norton elevate the whole movie so much with their ridiculously outstanding performances that these small issues don’t keep me away from highly recommending one of the most memorable, iconic films of all-time.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: A-",

      "content": "I didn't enjoy this, pretty much at all, but still kinda appreciate how it all comes together. It's a weird one for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, <em>'Fight Club'</em> underwhelmed me. I actually knew very little before viewing it, despite hearing about it on a surface level for years and years; well, one 'regulatory' part of it anyway. It's much deeper than I had expected. Unfortunately, I didn't find entertainment with any of it - it was, to be honest, a slog to sit through.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only scene I can remember enjoying is the very last one, and I don't mean that negatively because the end shot is terrific. It's just everything that comes before didn't do anything for me. Yet, I still rate its intentions. It did keep me guessing amidst my, near, boredom and the 'event' is a good one on paper. It just failed to connect on me in actuality.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrad Pitt is good as Tyler, though the likes of Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter give meh performances in my opinion. Meat Loaf is interesting, I guess, as Bob.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm evidently in the extreme minority with my thoughts, each to their own, but I honestly didn't get into it sadly. As noted, though, I still partially rate it weirdly. 6\* feels harsh, so I give it 7\*.",

      "content": "\_\*\*Finding enlightenment thru beating each other to a pulp\*\*\_\\r\\n\\r\\nA 30 year-old man in Los Angeles works the office drudgery, but suffers insomnia (Edward Norton). He’s finally inspired by an unconventional woman he meets at support groups (Helena Bonham Carter) and, especially, a devil-may-care guy who lives on the outskirts of town (Brad Pitt). They start an underground club where men get together and vent their frustrations by beating the crap out of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Fight Club\\" (1999) has a huge reputation as a stylish cult flick and is often ranked with the greatest films ever made. The first half is entertaining enough, both quirky and amusing; and I like the interesting themes explored: Escaping the maternal and material, being a slave to advertising, rebelling against life-stifling conformity, being a blind follower of a charismatic leader, finding your inner wild-man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Cool, the nature of lawless “revolutionaries” (which is too reminiscent of ANTIFA thugs), the struggle with homosexuality interpretation, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s all highly commendable. Unfortunately, the second half isn’t compelling. I sat there bored and couldn’t wait for it to end. “Donnie Darko” (2001) had the same problem – promising set-up with clever ideas, but a tedious wrap-up. Meanwhile the twist that everyone gushes over is actually underwhelming and not very surprising, although it’s relatively interesting. \\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, watching guys get radically beat up is only entertaining a couple times; after that it gets redundant. Speaking of which, how exactly does bare-knuckled fighting inspire or enlighten? Does it really help one’s life to have missing teeth, black eyes and other assorted injuries? Of course the movie doesn’t emphasize the long-lasting negative effects of regular brawling. Have you ever met a brawler, boxer or professional football player in his 50s with the perpetual aches & pains?\\r\\n\\r\\nCult flicks like “Pulp Fiction” (1994) deserve the praise and stand the test of time; this one disappoints mainly due to the curiously dull second half. But it's genius on the metaphorical level no doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is overlong at 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: B-",

      "overview": "From the midst of 9/11, one of the darkest moments in American history, comes this inspiring and relatively unknown story. When the twin towers fell, hundreds of thousands of people ran to the water's edge. They soon realized that Manhattan is, indeed, an island. And that they were trapped. Within moments, an armada of every vessel that could get to the city's seawall spontaneously organized. Dashing into the teeth of danger, hundreds of boats pulled together and, without any formal planning, military or otherwise, they pulled off an ad-hoc sea evacuation that became the largest in history. Their story of courage and resolve reminds us of the powerful spirit that rose among us, on that fateful day. Narrated by Tom Hanks. Directed by Eddie Rosenstein.",

Even to good boys all the way across the country in New Hampshire, the authority-flouting baseball A's and football Raiders were magical. Not only did they win championships, they did it amid clubhouse brawls, feuds with an owner and a general embrace of the 1960s aesthetic.  Filmmakers Rick Bernstein and Ross Greenburg tell the stories of these turbulent, talented teams and show how they perfectly fit their city. Oakland was blue collar and home to hardcore hard-core 1960s rebellion, exemplified by the Black Panthers. Oakland, especially, was not San Francisco, the effete, world-class city across the bay.\\"",

(SBS AU)  Geffen narrates his unorthodox rise from working class Brooklyn boy to billionaire entertainment power broker in extensive interviews.  American Masters explores the highs and the lows in Geffen’s professional and personal life through more than 50 new interviews with his friends, colleagues and clients, as well as other media luminaries.

Since then, it has grown into an organization that treats more than a million patients a year from all 50 states and 150 countries. Dr. Mayo had a simple philosophy he imparted to his sons Will and Charlie: \\"the needs of the patient come first.\\" They wouldn't treat diseases...they would treat people. In a world where healthcare delivery is typically fragmented among individual specialties, the Mayo Clinic practices a multi-specialty, team-based approach that has, from its beginnings, created a culture that thrives on collaboration.",

His older brother has gone to war, leaving Homer to look after his widowed mother, his older sister and his 4-year-old brother, Ulysses. And so it is that as spring turns to summer, 1942, Homer Macauley delivers messages of love, hope, pain... and death... to the good people of Ithaca. And Homer Macauley will grapple with one message that will change him forever - from a boy into a man. Based on Pulitzer Prize-winning author William Saroyan's 1943 novel, The Human Comedy, ITHACA is the quintessential wartime tale of the Home Front. It is a coming-of-age story about the exuberance of youth, the sweetness of life, the sting of death and the modesty and sheer goodness that lives in each and every one of us.",

The artists were polarized between newcomers hungry to innovate and old timers not yet ready to relinquish control. These conditions produced a series of box-office flops and pessimistic forecasts: maybe the best days of animation were over. Maybe the public didn't care. Only a miracle or a magic spell could produce a happy ending. Waking Sleeping Beauty is no fairy tale. It's the true story of how Disney regained its magic with a staggering output of hits - \\"Little Mermaid,\\" \\"Beauty and the Beast ,\\" \\"Aladdin,\\" \\"The Lion King,\\" and more - over a 10-year period.",

And so it is that as spring turns to summer, 1942, Homer Macauley delivers messages of love, hope, pain... and death... to the good people of Ithaca. And Homer Macauley will grapple with one message that will change him forever - from a boy into a man. Based on Pulitzer Prize-winning author William Saroyan's 1943 novel, The Human Comedy, ITHACA is the quintessential wartime tale of the Home Front. It is a coming-of-age story about the exuberance of youth, the sweetness of life, the sting of death and the modesty and sheer goodness that lives in each and every one of us.",

The weekday broadcast expanded to three hours in 2000, and to four hours in 2007.\\n\\nToday's dominance was virtually unchallenged by the other networks until the late 1980s, when it was overtaken by ABC's Good Morning America. Today retook the Nielsen ratings lead the week of December 11, 1995, and held onto that position for 852 consecutive weeks until the week of April 9, 2012, when it was beaten by Good Morning America yet again. In 2002, Today was ranked #17 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest Television  Shows of All Time.",

      "overview": "The Colbert Report is an American satirical late night television program that airs Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. It stars political humorist Stephen Colbert, a former correspondent for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. The Colbert Report is a spin-off from and counterpart to The Daily Show that comments on politics and the media in a similar way. It satirizes conservative personality-driven political pundit programs, particularly Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor. The show focuses on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits.\\n\\nThe Colbert Report has been nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards each in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, two Television Critics Association Awards Awards, and two Satellite Awards. In 2013, it won two Emmys. It has been presented as non-satirical journalism in several instances, including by the Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust and by Robert Wexler following his interview on the program. The Report received considerable media coverage following its debut on October 17, 2005, for Colbert's coining of the term \\"truthiness\\", which dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster named its 2006 Word of the Year.",

You may have noticed that the a v4 version of our list API exists. While these v3 list methods continue to work, all of the new features you can see on our website are only available if you switch to the v4 lists.

**What are some of the improvements in v4?**   You can import "unlimited" items in a single request
*   You can use mixed type (movie and TV) lists
*   You can use private lists
*   You can add and use comments per item
*   There are more sort options
*   They are faster
*   Check the v4 documentation for more information.
