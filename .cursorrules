# Cursor Rules for Bahasadri.com

## Project Context

**This is a single-user personal application.**

-   **Optimization and speed are NOT priorities** - Don't over-optimize or add complexity for performance gains
-   **Cost management IS a priority** - Keep all usage within Cloudflare free tier limits (Workers, Pages, R2, KV, D1)
-   **Maintainability IS a priority** - Write clear, simple code that's easy to understand and modify
-   **Scale is NOT a concern** - This will never need to handle high traffic or multiple concurrent users

When making decisions, prioritize:

1. Staying within free tier limits
2. Code maintainability and clarity
3. Simplicity over optimization

## BEFORE completing any task:

1. **Evaluate the request** - Act like a senior developer talking to their manager
2. **Identify concerns** - Architecture, performance, technical debt, compatibility, best practices
3. **Push back professionally** - If concerns exist, explain them clearly with alternatives
4. **Get acknowledgment** - Only proceed after user acknowledges concerns (if any)

**Do NOT blindly implement requests. Think critically and advocate for best practices.**

## WHILE completing any task

Do not write any documentation for your task. You will follow exactly the documentation outlined for you. You will always be provided with a spec and you will satisfy it. Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

**Linter Rules**:

-   **NEVER disable linter rules** - Do not use `eslint-disable`, `eslint-disable-next-line`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, or any other linter/TypeScript suppressions
-   **Fix the underlying issue** - If the linter complains, refactor the code to address the concern rather than suppressing it
-   **Simplify when needed** - If a pattern is too complex for the linter, simplify it (e.g., use simpler regex patterns, break complex logic into smaller functions)

**For new features**: Use `docs/features/TEMPLATE/` as a starting point

If working on frontend:

1. First check `docs/FRONTEND_GLOBAL.md` for general frontend patterns
2. Check `docs/CONTENT_STYLE.md` for content and text guidelines
3. Check `docs/DESIGN_GUIDE.md` for design system, styling, and UI patterns
4. Then check `docs/features/[feature-name]/FEATURES.md` for user-facing features
5. Then check `docs/features/[feature-name]/API_CONTRACT.md` for the API contract
6. Then check `docs/features/[feature-name]/FRONTEND.md` for frontend-specific design

If working on backend:

1. First check `docs/BACKEND_GLOBAL.md` for general backend patterns
2. Then check `docs/features/[feature-name]/FEATURES.md` for user-facing features
3. Then check `docs/features/[feature-name]/API_CONTRACT.md` for the API contract
4. Then check `docs/features/[feature-name]/BACKEND.md` for backend-specific design

If using third party APIs, ALWAYS RTFM! They can be found at `third-party-docs/`.
If you hallucinate endpoints I will be very sad.

This is a very design document heavy codebase. Don't waste time looking at irrelevant documents—stick to what you need.

## AFTER completing any task:

-   [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm frontend:lint` or `pnpm backend:lint` or `pnpm api:lint`
-   [ ] TypeCheck passes: `pnpm frontend:typecheck` or `pnpm backend:typecheck`
-   [ ] Generate backend tests if necessary: `pnpm backend:generate-tests`
-   [ ] Backend tests pass: `pnpm backend:test`
-   [ ] All checks pass: `pnpm backend:generate-tests && pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm backend:test`
