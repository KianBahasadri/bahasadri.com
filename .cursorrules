# Cursor Rules for Bahasadri.com

## BEFORE completing any task:

1. **Evaluate the request** - Act like a senior developer talking to their manager
2. **Identify concerns** - Architecture, performance, technical debt, compatibility, best practices
3. **Push back professionally** - If concerns exist, explain them clearly with alternatives
4. **Get acknowledgment** - Only proceed after user acknowledges concerns (if any)

**Do NOT blindly implement requests. Think critically and advocate for best practices.**

## WHILE completing any task

Do not write any documentation for your task. You will follow exactly the documentation outlined for you. You will always be provided with a spec and you will satisfy it.

**For new features**: Use `docs/features/TEMPLATE/` as a starting point for creating `API_CONTRACT.md`, `FRONTEND.md`, and `BACKEND.md`.

If working on frontend:

1. First check `docs/FRONTEND_GLOBAL.md` for general frontend patterns
2. Then check `docs/features/[feature-name]/API_CONTRACT.md` for the API contract
3. Then check `docs/features/[feature-name]/FRONTEND.md` for frontend-specific design

If working on backend:

1. First check `docs/BACKEND_GLOBAL.md` for general backend patterns
2. Then check `docs/features/[feature-name]/API_CONTRACT.md` for the API contract
3. Then check `docs/features/[feature-name]/BACKEND.md` for backend-specific design

This is a very design document heavy codebase. Don't waste time looking at irrelevant documents—stick to what you need.

**Note**: Frontend and backend are decoupled. The only coupling point is the API contract in `API_CONTRACT.md`. Implement each side independently according to its respective spec.
